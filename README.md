 My first experience creating a game application with javascript and jquery.  I left it here intentionally for self-assessment, and a future teaching tool for new coders.

As I rewrite this piece and correct repetitive and unnecessary codes, I plan to document what I find are common errors in a beginner may face concerning rules of javascript.
